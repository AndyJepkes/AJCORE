# A Quick 'n Dirty PHP Framework (Pre-Alpha)

<img src="http://andyjepkes.com/images/Puzzle_logo_100x100.png" align="left">

This is a PHP framework made to quickly stand up a PHP website. I started this project to combat the time I would spend standing up a new website. Other frameworks like wordpress come with lots of features that I'm usually not interested in using. This framework is meant to give more utilities for the developer and less to the content editor, although it's still evolving.

##Features
A neat (but totally unsecure) developer mode that gives you helpful information about the website, like a groovy flowchart to help you understand where important code lives.

###Not implemented
* Basic DB functionality
* Basic authentication
* User preference utility

##Getting started
If you really want to try it out here's the best way to start.

set up the site_settings.php
set up a module_config.php
Scripts and Styles will load in the HTML head.
Web content in the modules folder will render in the body.
